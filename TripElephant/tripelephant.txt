Hi Jordan,

Thank you for applying to the SQL Reporting Analyst role at TripElephant.

As part of our screening process, we ask that you please complete a short technical question.

Data

Attached is an archive of three tables in CSV. These tables represent a hierarchy of region information in Canada. Countrylist is the list of countries, Provinces is the list of states/provinces, and Regionlist contains a link of smaller regions, with the parentregionid column outlining that row's parent.

The data is a subset, to make the analysis simpler and more straightforward. Please assume that each of the tables will have a large amount data for the purposes of your solution. Please also assume that the regionlist.csv table, has multiple levels of hierarchy - it could be 3 levels (country->province->city) or more (country->province->city->city->region->region->..->point of interest).

Question:

Write an SQL statement that returns exactly one row with columns:

region_id, region_name, province_name, province_code, country_name, country_code
for any given regionid. It's preferable to have an SQL statement, not a function with a loop structure.

We use PostgreSQL.
